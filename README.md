matlab_NS_solvers
=================

Old research code. Chiefly a 2D NS solver in the vorticity formulation. Some 1D tests of solving equations using spectral methods.

Also contains the matlab implementation of the 3d linear stability routine. Plus some other old ideas that never went anywhere.

All code is written in Matlab and was written in Winter 2012.
